## Introduction
Welcome to our dog sharing platform! Here's how it works: create an account on the app. You can then browse through dogs other usrrs have uploaded, search by breed or location, and upload dogs of your own. If you find one you like, take a look at the show page page, read some info about the owner and make an appointment to spend some good quality dog time!

## Ruby versions
- Ruby '3.0.3'
- Rails '7.0.3'

## Installation
- Pull the project from this public repository.

- Run `rails db:create db:migrate` in your terminal to set up the database.
- Finally, run `rails server` and navigate to 'localhost:3000' in your web browser to start using the app!
